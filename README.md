### The Video Poker games

- Aces and Faces
  - Aces and Faces is a Jacks or Better variation that has a higher payout for certain Four-of-a-Kinds. This bonus is partially offset by a lower payout for a Full House or Flush. The long-term payback for this machine is 99.85%, which is slightly better than Jacks or Better.

- Deuces Wild
  - In Deuces Wild, all four 2s are wild cards. They can represent any card value or suit that is necessary to complete a winning hand. Since it is easier to get good hands, the payout table has been adjusted from a standard Jacks or Better payout table. Also, because there are four wild cards, new winning hands have been added to the payout table: Four Deuces, Wild Royal Flush and Five of a Kind. Players using optimal strategy on an original full-pay version of Deuces Wild can expect a long term payout of 100.76%, which is one of the few games in the casino where the player has an advantage over the house.

- Double Joker Poker
  - Double Joker poker uses a 54-card deck which includes two wild Jokers. This game offers a long-term payback of 99.96% using optimal strategy.

- Jacks or Better
  - The original Video Poker machines were based on Five Card Draw Poker and paid off on Two Pair or better. Because of the low overall payoff the machines evolved into Jacks or Better Video Poker which pays even on a high pair. Jacks or Better has become the popular standard from which all other variations have grown. The long-term payout for a machine with this pay table is 99.54% using optimal strategy.

- Joker Wild
  - This game uses a 53-card deck that includes one wild Joker. Joker Wild offers a long-term payback of 100.6%. Beware of Joker Wild machines with a minimum paying hand of 2 Pair, these machines offer a long term payback of below 99%.
